## My name is Gianni Smit

I'm a 20 year old guy from the Netherlands and I like to code things from time to time in my free time. Primairily in TS/JS, PHP and HTML/CSS

Most of the things I do are in private repos or not in github, but I am working on an Text adventure/RPG game in JS that will eventually be published to GitHub, Though it's still in the early stages.

Things I'm planning or doing;
- Text adventure / RPG game (name pending) --- Early draft stages
- Mister-S-2003.github.io -- Probably will be updated at some point
